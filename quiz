1) What is the mass of a photon?
The mass of photon is 0.
2) What is the size of a quark?
Size of quark is less than 10^(-18)
3) What is the difference between electrical charge and color charge?
Color charge is a property of quark of quarks and gluons, electrical charge is a characteristic of a unit of matter.
4) Explain the difference between a boson and a fermion?
Boson has integer spin, but fermion has one half spin.
5) Describe what type of particle is both a boson and a hadron.  Give and example.
Meson is both a boson and a hadron because its spin is interger and it is made from quarks-anti.
6) Explain the purpose of a bubble chamber.
To make the tracks of ionizing particles visible as a row of bubbles in a liquid.
7) What are leptons made of?
Leptons made of blocks of matter.
8) Name two leptons and two baryons.
Two Leptons: electron muon
Two Baryons: proton neutron
9) Explain what quantities are conserved at each vertex of a Feynmenn diagram.
Geynmann diagram shows electromagnetic interaction between subatomic paricle.
10) Explain what an "exchange particle" is.  Describe its function and provide an example.
Gluons is the excharge particles example. The color force between the quarks. It can be considered to be the fundamental 
exchange particle underlying the strong interaction between protons and neutrons in a nucleus.
