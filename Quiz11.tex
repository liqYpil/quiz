1) What is the mass of a photon?
0
2) What is the size of a quark?
7 Ã— 10^21 m
3) What is the difference between electrical charge and color charge?
Color is a property of quarks and gluons, but electircal charge is just a characterstic of a unit of matter.
4) Explain the difference between a boson and a fermion?
Boson have to have interger spin, fermion has 0.5 spin. Also bosons can have same state, but fermion cannot have same state.
5) Describe what type of particle is both a boson and a hadron.  Give and example.
Meson is both a boson and a hadron, because its spin is integer and it is made from quarks-anti.
6) Explain the purpose of a bubble chamber.
To make teh tracks of ionizing particles visible as a row of bubbles in a liquid.
7) What are leptons made of?
Leptons made odf blocks of matter.
8) Name two leptons and two baryons.
Leptons: electron muon
baryons:proton neutron
9) Explain what quantities are conserved at each vertex of a Feynmenn diagram.
Feymann diagram shows electronmagnetic interaction between subatomic particle.
10) Explain what an "exchange particle" is.  Describe its function and provide an example.
Gluons are the exchange particles for the color force between quarks, analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic 
force between two charged particles. It can be considered as a force stick protons and neutrons together.
